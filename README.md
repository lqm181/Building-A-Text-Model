# Building-A-Text-Model
A TextModel class that provides the neccessary methods to construct models from text sources and compare different text models. An example for the application of the program is to determine whether a mysterious article is more likely to come from The New York Times or from The Wall Street Journal. 

This served as a final project for my CS111 class.
